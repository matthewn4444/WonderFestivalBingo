Wonder Festival is one of my favorite times a year with new anime figures getting announced. The excitement around these figures has generated people to create bingo cards for their hopes and dreams. With this app, it is a lot easier to create bingo cards

*We do not own the pictures or sound used in this app, Wonder Festival or their logos, or any affiliation with myfigurecollection.net. This app was made for fun.*

## Usage

* Start the app and **accept the permissions to read/write to storage**, this is how it can load and save images into your bingo squares.

* In the menu bar, click the edit icon to go into edit mode where you can select a square to modify

* In the edit dialog, you can specify a category, type or label for the figure/character.
* Next you can paste a supported link from **myfigurecollection.net** (item or picture webpage) or any image link found on the internet.

* In the edit dialog you can also open an image locally on your device.

* In edit mode you can also **shuffle** your bingo sheet

* In normal mode, you can tap a square after it is named to put a stamp on it, once you have 5 in a row you will get a bingo!

* Finally share your bingo sheet with friends with the share button at the menu bar
